module: shell
short_description: Execute commands in nodes.
description:
     - The C(shell) module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments.
       It is almost exactly like the M(command) module but runs
       the command through a shell (C(/bin/sh)) on the remote node.
     - For Windows targets, use the M(win_shell) module instead.

  free_form:
    description:
      - The shell module takes a free form command to run, as a string.  There's not an actual
        option named "free form".  See the examples!

notes:
  -  If you want to execute a command securely and predictably, it may be
     better to use the M(command) module instead. Best practices when writing
     playbooks will follow the trend of using M(command) unless the C(shell)
     module is explicitly required. When running ad-hoc commands, use your best
     judgement.
  -  To sanitize any variables passed to the shell module, you should use
     "{{ var | quote }}" instead of just "{{ var }}" to make sure they don't include evil things like semicolons.
  - For Windows targets, use the M(win_shell) module instead.
  - Rather than using here documents to create multi-line scripts inside playbooks,
    use the M(script) module instead.

EXAMPLES = '''
- name: Execute the command in remote shell; stdout goes to the specified file on the remote.
  shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt

- name: Change the working directory to somedir/ before executing the command.
  shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt
  args:
    chdir: somedir/

# You can also use the 'args' form to provide the options.
- name: This command will change the working directory to somedir/ and will only run when somedir/somelog.txt doesn't exist.
  shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt
  args:
    chdir: somedir/
    creates: somelog.txt

- name: Run a command that uses non-posix shell-isms (in this example /bin/sh doesn't handle redirection and wildcards together but bash does)
  shell: cat < /tmp/*txt
  args:
    executable: /bin/bash

- name: Run a command using a templated variable (always use quote filter to avoid injection)
  shell: cat {{ myfile|quote }}

# You can use shell to run other executables to perform actions inline
- name: Run expect to wait for a successful PXE boot via out-of-band CIMC
  shell: |
    set timeout 300
    spawn ssh admin@{{ cimc_host }}

    expect "password:"
    send "{{ cimc_password }}\\n"

    expect "\\n{{ cimc_name }}"
    send "connect host\\n"

    expect "pxeboot.n12"
    send "\\n"

    exit 0
