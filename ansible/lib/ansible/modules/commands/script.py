short_description: Runs a local script on a remote node after transferring it
description:
     - "The C(script) module takes the script name followed by a list of
       space-delimited arguments. "
     - "The local script at path will be transferred to the remote node and then executed. "
     - "The given script will be processed through the shell environment on the remote node. "
     - "This module does not require python on the remote system, much like
       the M(raw) module. "
     - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
options:
  free_form:
    description:
      - Path to the local script file followed by optional arguments. There is no parameter actually named 'free form'; see the examples!

    default: null
notes:
  - It is usually preferable to write Ansible modules than pushing scripts. Convert your script to an Ansible module for bonus points!
  - The ssh connection plugin will force pseudo-tty allocation via -tt when scripts are executed. pseudo-ttys do not have a stderr channel and all
    stderr is sent to stdout. If you depend on separated stdout and stderr result keys, please switch to a copy+command set of tasks instead of using script.
  - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
  - If the path to the local script contains spaces, it needs to be quoted.
