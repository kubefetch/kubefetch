DOCUMENTATION = '''
module: meta
short_description: Execute Ansible 'actions'
version_added: "1.2"
description:
    - Meta tasks are a special kind of task which can influence Ansible internal execution or state. Prior to Ansible 2.0,
      the only meta option available was `flush_handlers`. As of 2.2, there are five meta tasks which can be used.
      Meta tasks can be used anywhere within your playbook.
    - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
options:
  free_form:
    description:
        - This module takes a free form command, as a string. There's not an actual option named "free form".  See the examples!
        - >
          C(flush_handlers) makes Ansible run any handler tasks which have thus far been notified. Ansible inserts these tasks internally at certain
          points to implicitly trigger handler runs (after pre/post tasks, the final role execution, and the main tasks section of your plays).
        - >
          C(refresh_inventory) (added in 2.0) forces the reload of the inventory, which in the case of dynamic inventory scripts means they will be
          re-executed. This is mainly useful when additional hosts are created and users wish to use them instead of using the `add_host` module."
        - "C(noop) (added in 2.0) This literally does 'nothing'. It is mainly used internally and not recommended for general use."
        - "C(clear_facts) (added in 2.1) causes the gathered facts for the hosts specified in the play's list of hosts to be cleared, including the fact cache."
        - "C(clear_host_errors) (added in 2.1) clears the failed state (if any) from hosts specified in the play's list of hosts."
        - "C(end_play) (added in 2.2) causes the play to end without failing the host."
        - "C(reset_connection) (added in 2.3) interrupts a persistent connection (i.e. ssh + control persist)"
    choices: ['noop', 'flush_handlers', 'refresh_inventory', 'clear_facts', 'clear_host_errors', 'end_play', 'reset_connection']
    required: true
notes:
    - C(meta) is not really a module nor action_plugin as such it cannot be overwritten.
    - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
