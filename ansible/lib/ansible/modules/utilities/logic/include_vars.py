module: include_vars
short_description: Load variables from files, dynamically within a task
description:
  - Loads variables from a YAML/JSON files dynamically from within a file or from a directory recursively during task
    runtime. If loading a directory, the files are sorted alphabetically before being loaded.
  - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
version_added: "1.4"
options:
  file:
    version_added: "2.2"
    description:
      - The file name from which variables should be loaded.
      - If the path is relative, it will look for the file in vars/ subdirectory of a role or relative to playbook.
  dir:
    version_added: "2.2"
    description:
      - The directory name from which the variables should be loaded.
      - If the path is relative, it will look for the file in vars/ subdirectory of a role or relative to playbook.
    default: null
  name:
    version_added: "2.2"
    description:
      - The name of a variable into which assign the included vars. If omitted (null) they will be made top level vars.
    default: null
  depth:
    version_added: "2.2"
    description:
      - When using C(dir), this module will, by default, recursively go through each sub directory and load up the
        variables. By explicitly setting the depth, this module will only go as deep as the depth.
    default: 0
  files_matching:
    version_added: "2.2"
    description:
      - Limit the files that are loaded within any directory to this regular expression.
    default: null
  ignore_files:
    version_added: "2.2"
    description:
      - List of file names to ignore.
    default: null

    description:
      - List of file extensions to read when using C(dir).
    default: [yaml, yml, json]
    required: False
  free-form:
    description:
      - This module allows you to specify the 'file' option directly without any other options.
        There is no 'free-form' option, this is just an indicator, see example below.
notes:
  - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
