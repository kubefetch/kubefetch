module: import_role
short_description: Import a role into a play
description:
  - Much like the `roles:` keyword, this task loads a role, but it allows you to control it when the role tasks run in
    between other tasks of the play.
  - Most keywords, loops and conditionals will only be applied to the imported tasks, not to this statement itself. If
    you want the opposite behaviour, use M(include_role) instead.
version_added: "2.4"
options:
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the role to be executed.
    required: True
  tasks_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(tasks/) directory.
    required: False
    default: main
  vars_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(vars/) directory.
    required: False
    default: main
  defaults_from:
    description:
      - File to load from a role's C(defaults/) directory.
    required: False
    default: main
  allow_duplicates:
    description:
      - Overrides the role's metadata setting to allow using a role more than once with the same parameters.
    required: False
    default: True
  private:
    description:
      - If C(True) the variables from C(defaults/) and C(vars/) in a role will not be made available to the rest of the
        play.
    default: None
notes:
  - Handlers are made available to the whole play.
