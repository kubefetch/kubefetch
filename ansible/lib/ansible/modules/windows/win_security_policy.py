short_description: changes local security policy settings
description:
- Allows you to set the local security policies that are configured by
  SecEdit.exe.

- If you are in a domain environment these policies may be set by a GPO policy,
  this module can temporarily change these values but the GPO will override
  it if the value differs.

  current policies set on your system.
