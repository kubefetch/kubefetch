version_added: "2.1"
options:
  pre_reboot_delay:
    description:
    - Seconds for shutdown to wait before requesting reboot
    default: 2
    aliases: [ pre_reboot_delay_sec ]
  post_reboot_delay:
    description:
    - Seconds to wait after the reboot was successful and the connection was re-established

    default: 0
    version_added: '2.4'
    aliases: [ post_reboot_delay_sec ]
  shutdown_timeout:
    description:
    - Maximum seconds to wait for shutdown to occur
    - Increase this timeout for very slow hardware, large update applications, etc
    default: 600
    aliases: [ shutdown_timeout_sec ]
  reboot_timeout:
    description:
    - Maximum seconds to wait for machine to re-appear on the network and respond to a test command
    - This timeout is evaluated separately for both network appearance and test command success (so maximum clock time is actually twice this value)

    aliases: [ reboot_timeout_sec ]
  connect_timeout:
    description:
    - Maximum seconds to wait for a single successful TCP connection to the WinRM endpoint before trying again
