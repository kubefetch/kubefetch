module: win_regedit
version_added: '2.0'
short_description: Add, change, or remove registry keys and values
description:
- Add, modify or remove registry keys and values.
- More information about the windows registry from Wikipedia
  U(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry).
options:
  path:
    description:
    - Name of the registry path.
    - 'Should be in one of the following registry hives: HKCC, HKCR, HKCU,
      HKLM, HKU.'
    required: true
    aliases: [ key ]
  name:
    description:
    - Name of the registry entry in the above C(path) parameters.
    - If not provided, or empty then the '(Default)' property for the key will
      be used.
    aliases: [ entry ]
  data:
    description:
    - Value of the registry entry C(name) in C(path).
    - If not specified then the value for the property will be null for the
      corresponding C(type).
    - Binary and None data should be expressed in a yaml byte array or as comma
      separated hex values.
    - An easy way to generate this is to run C(regedit.exe) and use the
      I(export) option to save the registry values to a file.
    - In the exported file, binary value will look like C(hex:be,ef,be,ef), the
      C(hex:) prefix is optional.
    - DWORD and QWORD values should either be represented as a decimal number
      or a hex value.
    - Multistring values should be passed in as a list.
    - See the examples for more details on how to format this data.
  type:
    description:
    - The registry value data type.
    choices: [ binary, dword, expandstring, multistring, string, qword ]
    default: string
    aliases: [ datatype ]
  state:
    description:
    - The state of the registry entry.
    choices: [ present, absent ]
    default: present
  delete_key:
    description:
    - When C(state) is 'absent' then this will delete the entire key.
    - If this is False then it will only clear out the '(Default)' property for
      that key.
    type: bool
    default: 'yes'
    version_added: '2.4'
notes:
- Check-mode C(-C/--check) and diff output C(-D/--diff) are supported, so that you can test every change against the active configuration before
  applying changes.
- Beware that some registry hives (C(HKEY_USERS) in particular) do not allow to create new registry paths.
- Since ansible 2.4, when checking if a string registry value has changed, a case-sensitive test is used. Previously the test was case-insensitive.
