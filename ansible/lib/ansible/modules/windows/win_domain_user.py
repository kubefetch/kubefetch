description:
     - Manages Windows Active Directory user accounts.
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Name of the user to create, remove or modify.
    required: true
  state:
    description:
      - When C(present), creates or updates the user account.  When C(absent),
        removes the user account if it exists.  When C(query),
        retrieves the user account details without making any changes.
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - query
    default: present
  enabled:
    description:
      - C(yes) will enable the user account. C(no) will disable the account.
    type: bool
    default: 'yes'
  account_locked:
    description:
      - C(no) will unlock the user account if locked. Note that there is not a
        way to lock an account as an administrator. Accounts are locked due to
        user actions; as an admin, you may only unlock a locked account. If you
        wish to administratively disable an account, set 'enabled' to 'no'.
    choices: [ 'no' ]
    type: bool
  description:
    description:
      - Description of the user
  groups:
    description:
      - Adds or removes the user from this list of groups,
        depending on the value of I(groups_action). To remove all but the
        Principal Group, set C(groups=<principal group name>) and
        I(groups_action=replace). Note that users cannot be removed from
        their principal group (for example, "Domain Users").
  groups_action:
    description:
      - If C(replace), the user is added as a member of each group in
        I(groups) and removed from any other groups.  If C(add), the user is
        added to each group in I(groups) where not already a member.  If
        C(remove), the user is removed from each group in I(groups).
    choices: [ 'replace', 'add', 'remove' ]
    default: replace
  password:
    description:
      - Optionally set the user's password to this (plain text) value. In order
        to enable an account - I(enabled) - a password must already be
        configured on the account, or you must provide a password here.
  update_password:
    description:
      - C(always) will update passwords if they differ.  C(on_create) will
        only set the password for newly created users. Note that C(always) will
        always report an Ansible status of 'changed' because we cannot
        determine whether the new password differs from the old password.
    choices: [ 'always', 'on_create' ]
    default: always
  password_expired:
    description:
      - C(yes) will require the user to change their password at next login.
        C(no) will clear the expired password flag. This is mutually exclusive
        with I(password_never_expires).
    type: bool
  password_never_expires:
    description:
      - C(yes) will set the password to never expire.  C(no) will allow the
        password to expire. This is mutually exclusive with I(password_expired)
    type: bool
  user_cannot_change_password:
    description:
      - C(yes) will prevent the user from changing their password.  C(no) will
        allow the user to change their password.
    type: bool
  firstname:
    description:
      - Configures the user's first name (given name)
  surname:
    description:
      - Configures the user's last name (surname)
  company:
    description:
      - Configures the user's company name
  upn:
    description:
      - Configures the User Principal Name (UPN) for the account. This is not
        required, but is best practice to configure for modern versions of
        Active Directory. The format is "<username>@<domain>".
  email:
    description:
      - Configures the user's email address. This is a record in AD and does
        not do anything to configure any email servers or systems.
  street:
    description:
      - Configures the user's street address
  city:
    description:
      - Configures the user's city
  state_province:
    description:
      - Configures the user's state or province
  postal_code:
    description:
      - Configures the user's postal code / zip code
  country:
    description:
      - Configures the user's country code. Note that this is a two-character
        ISO 3166 code.
  path:
    description:
      - Container or OU for the new user; if you do not specify this, the
        user will be placed in the default container for users in the domain.
        Setting the path is only available when a new user is created;
        if you specify a path on an existing user, the user's path will not
        be updated - you must delete (e.g., state=absent) the user and
        then re-add the user with the appropriate path.
notes:
  - Works with Windows 2012R2 and newer.
  - If running on a server that is not a Domain Controller, credential
    delegation through CredSSP or Kerberos with delegation must be used.
  - Note that some individuals have confirmed successful operation on Windows
    2008R2 servers with AD and AD Web Services enabled, but this has not
    received the same degree of testing as Windows 2012R2.
