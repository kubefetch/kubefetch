module: win_mapped_drive
version_added: '2.4'
short_description: maps a network drive for a user
description:
- Allows you to modify mapped network drives for individual users.
notes:
- This can only map a network drive for the current executing user and does not
  allow you to set a default drive for all users of a system. Use other
  Microsoft tools like GPOs to achieve this goal.
- You cannot use this module to access a mapped drive in another Ansible task,
  drives mapped with this module are only accessible when logging in
  interactively with the user through the console or RDP.
options:
  letter:
    description:
    - The letter of the network path to map to.
    - This letter must not already be in use with Windows.
    required: yes
  password:
    description:
    - The password for C(username).
  path:
    description:
    - The UNC path to map the drive to.
    - This is required if C(state=present).
    - If C(state=absent) and path is not set, the module will delete the mapped
      drive regardless of the target.
    - If C(state=absent) and the path is set, the module will throw an error if
      path does not match the target of the mapped drive.
  state:
    description:
    - If C(state=present) will ensure the mapped drive exists.
    - If C(state=absent) will ensure the mapped drive does not exist.
    choices: [ absent, present ]
    default: present
  username:
    description:
    - Credentials to map the drive with.
    - The username MUST include the domain or servername like SERVER\user, see
      the example for more information.
