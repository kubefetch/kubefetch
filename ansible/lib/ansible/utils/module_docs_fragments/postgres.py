notes:
- The default authentication assumes that you are either logging in as or sudo'ing to the C(postgres) account on the host.
- This module uses I(psycopg2), a Python PostgreSQL database adapter. You must ensure that psycopg2 is installed on
  the host before using this module. If the remote host is the PostgreSQL server (which is the default case), then
  PostgreSQL must also be installed on the remote host. For Ubuntu-based systems, install the C(postgresql), C(libpq-dev),
  and C(python-psycopg2) packages on the remote host before using this module.
- The ssl_rootcert parameter requires at least Postgres version 8.4 and I(psycopg2) version 2.4.3.
