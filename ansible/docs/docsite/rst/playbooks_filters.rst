Filters
-------

.. contents:: Topics


Filters in Ansible are from Jinja2, and are used for transforming data inside a template expression.  Jinja2 ships with many filters. See `builtin filters`_ in the official Jinja2 template documentation.

Take into account that templating happens on the Ansible controller, **not** on the task's target host, so filters also execute on the controller as they manipulate local data.

In addition the ones provided by Jinja2, Ansible ships with it's own and allows users to add their own custom filters.

.. _filters_for_formatting_data:

Filters For Formatting Data
```````````````````````````

The following filters will take a data structure in a template and render it in a slightly different format.  These
are occasionally useful for debugging::

    {{ some_variable | to_json }}
    {{ some_variable | to_yaml }}

For human readable output, you can use::

    {{ some_variable | to_nice_json }}
    {{ some_variable | to_nice_yaml }}

It's also possible to change the indentation of both (new in version 2.2)::

    {{ some_variable | to_nice_json(indent=2) }}
    {{ some_variable | to_nice_yaml(indent=8) }}

Alternatively, you may be reading in some already formatted data::

    {{ some_variable | from_json }}
    {{ some_variable | from_yaml }}

for example::

    tasks:
      - shell: cat /some/path/to/file.json
        register: result

      - set_fact: myvar="{{ result.stdout | from_json }}"

.. _forcing_variables_to_be_defined:

Forcing Variables To Be Defined
```````````````````````````````

The default behavior from ansible and ansible.cfg is to fail if variables are undefined, but you can turn this off.

This allows an explicit check with this feature off::

    {{ variable | mandatory }}

The variable value will be used as is, but the template evaluation will raise an error if it is undefined.


.. _defaulting_undefined_variables:

Defaulting Undefined Variables
``````````````````````````````

Jinja2 provides a useful 'default' filter, that is often a better approach to failing if a variable is not defined::

    {{ some_variable | default(5) }}

In the above example, if the variable 'some_variable' is not defined, the value used will be 5, rather than an error
being raised.


.. _omitting_undefined_variables:

Omitting Parameters
```````````````````

As of Ansible 1.8, it is possible to use the default filter to omit module parameters using the special `omit` variable::

    - name: touch files with an optional mode
      file: dest={{item.path}} state=touch mode={{item.mode|default(omit)}}
      with_items:
        - path: /tmp/foo
        - path: /tmp/bar
        - path: /tmp/baz
          mode: "0444"

For the first two files in the list, the default mode will be determined by the umask of the system as the `mode=`
parameter will not be sent to the file module while the final file will receive the `mode=0444` option.

.. note:: If you are "chaining" additional filters after the `default(omit)` filter, you should instead do something like this:
      `"{{ foo | default(None) | some_filter or omit }}"`. In this example, the default `None` (python null) value will cause the
      later filters to fail, which will trigger the `or omit` portion of the logic. Using omit in this manner is very specific to
      the later filters you're chaining though, so be prepared for some trial and error if you do this.

.. _list_filters:

List Filters
````````````

These filters all operate on list variables.

.. versionadded:: 1.8

To get the minimum value from list of numbers::

    {{ list1 | min }}

To get the maximum value from a list of numbers::

    {{ [3, 4, 2] | max }}

.. _set_theory_filters:

Set Theory Filters
``````````````````
All these functions return a unique set from sets or lists.

.. versionadded:: 1.4

To get a unique set from a list::

    {{ list1 | unique }}

To get a union of two lists::

    {{ list1 | union(list2) }}

To get the intersection of 2 lists (unique list of all items in both)::

    {{ list1 | intersect(list2) }}

To get the difference of 2 lists (items in 1 that don't exist in 2)::

    {{ list1 | difference(list2) }}

To get the symmetric difference of 2 lists (items exclusive to each list)::

    {{ list1 | symmetric_difference(list2) }}


.. _random_filter:

Random Number Filter
````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 1.6

This filter can be used similar to the default jinja2 random filter (returning a random item from a sequence of
items), but can also generate a random number based on a range.

To get a random item from a list::

    "{{ ['a','b','c']|random }}"
    # => 'c'

To get a random number between 0 and a specified number::

    "{{ 60 |random}} * * * * root /script/from/cron"
    # => '21 * * * * root /script/from/cron'

Get a random number from 0 to 100 but in steps of 10::

    {{ 101 |random(step=10) }}
    # => 70

Get a random number from 1 to 100 but in steps of 10::

    {{ 101 |random(1, 10) }}
    # => 31
    {{ 101 |random(start=1, step=10) }}
    # => 51

As of Ansible version 2.3, it's also possible to initialize the random number generator from a seed. This way, you can create random-but-idempotent numbers::

    "{{ 60 |random(seed=inventory_hostname) }} * * * * root /script/from/cron"


Shuffle Filter
``````````````

.. versionadded:: 1.8

This filter will randomize an existing list, giving a different order every invocation.

To get a random list from an existing  list::

    {{ ['a','b','c']|shuffle }}
    # => ['c','a','b']
    {{ ['a','b','c']|shuffle }}
    # => ['b','c','a']

As of Ansible version 2.3, it's also possible to shuffle a list idempotent. All you need is a seed.::

    {{ ['a','b','c']|shuffle(seed=inventory_hostname) }}
    # => ['b','a','c']

note that when used with a non 'listable' item it is a noop, otherwise it always returns a list


.. _math_stuff:

Math
````

.. versionadded:: 1.9


Get the logarithm (default is e)::

    {{ myvar | log }}

Get the base 10 logarithm::

    {{ myvar | log(10) }}

Give me the power of 2! (or 5)::

    {{ myvar | pow(2) }}
    {{ myvar | pow(5) }}

Square root, or the 5th::

    {{ myvar | root }}
    {{ myvar | root(5) }}

Note that jinja2 already provides some like abs() and round().

.. json_query_filter:

JSON Query Filter
`````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.2

Sometimes you end up with a complex data structure in JSON format and you need to extract only a small set of data within it. The **json_query** filter lets you query a complex JSON structure and iterate over it using a with_items structure.

.. note:: This filter is built upon **jmespath**, and you can use the same syntax. For examples, see `jmespath examples <http://jmespath.org/examples.html>`_.

Now, let's take the following data structure::

    domain_definition:
        domain:
            cluster:
                - name: "cluster1"
                - name: "cluster2"
            server:
                - name: "server11"
                  cluster: "cluster1"
                  port: "8080"
                - name: "server12"
                  cluster: "cluster1"
                  port: "8090"
                - name: "server21"
                  cluster: "cluster2"
                  port: "9080"
                - name: "server22"
                  cluster: "cluster2"
                  port: "9090"
            library:
                - name: "lib1"
                  target: "cluster1"
                - name: "lib2"
                  target: "cluster2"

To extract all clusters from this structure, you can use the following query::

    - name: "Display all cluster names"
      debug: var=item
      with_items: "{{domain_definition|json_query('domain.cluster[*].name')}}"

Same thing for all server names::

    - name: "Display all server names"
      debug: var=item
      with_items: "{{domain_definition|json_query('domain.server[*].name')}}"

This example shows ports from cluster1::

    - name: "Display all server names from cluster1"
      debug: var=item
      with_items: "{{domain_definition|json_query(server_name_cluster1_query)}}"
      vars:
        server_name_cluster1_query: "domain.server[?cluster=='cluster1'].port"

.. note:: You can use a variable to make the query more readable.

In this example, we get a hash map with all ports and names of a cluster::

    - name: "Display all server ports and names from cluster1"
      debug: var=item
      with_items: "{{domain_definition|json_query(server_name_cluster1_query)}}"
      vars:
        server_name_cluster1_query: "domain.server[?cluster=='cluster2'].{name: name, port: port}"

.. _ipaddr_filter:

IP address filter
`````````````````

.. versionadded:: 1.9

To test if a string is a valid IP address::

  {{ myvar | ipaddr }}

You can also require a specific IP protocol version::

  {{ myvar | ipv4 }}
  {{ myvar | ipv6 }}

IP address filter can also be used to extract specific information from an IP
address. For example, to get the IP address itself from a CIDR, you can use::

  {{ '192.0.2.1/24' | ipaddr('address') }}

More information about ``ipaddr`` filter and complete usage guide can be found
in :doc:`playbooks_filters_ipaddr`.

.. _network_filters:

Network CLI filters
```````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.4

To convert the output of a network device CLI command into structured JSON
output, use the ``parse_cli`` filter::

  {{ output | parse_cli('path/to/spec') }}

The ``parse_cli`` filter will load the spec file and pass the command output
through, it returning JSON output.  The spec file is a YAML yaml that defines
how to parse the CLI output.

The spec file should be valid formatted YAML.  It defines how to parse the CLI
output and return JSON data.  Below is an example of a valid spec file that
will parse the output from the ``show vlan`` command.::

    ---
    vars:
      vlan:
        vlan_id: "{{ item.vlan_id }}"
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        enabled: "{{ item.state != 'act/lshut' }}"
        state: "{{ item.state }}"

    keys:
      vlans:
        type: list
        value: "{{ vlan }}"
        items: "^(?P<vlan_id>\\d+)\\s+(?P<name>\\w+)\\s+(?P<state>active|act/lshut|suspended)"
      state_static:
        value: present

The spec file above will return a JSON data structure that is a list of hashes
with the parsed VLAN information.

The same command could be parsed into a hash by using the key and values
directives.  Here is an example of how to parse the output into a hash
value using the same ``show vlan`` command.::

    ---
    vars:
      vlan:
        key: "{{ item.vlan_id }}"
        values:
          vlan_id: "{{ item.vlan_id }}"
          name: "{{ item.name }}"
          enabled: "{{ item.state != 'act/lshut' }}"
          state: "{{ item.state }}"

    keys:
      vlans:
        type: list
        value: "{{ vlan }}"
        items: "^(?P<vlan_id>\\d+)\\s+(?P<name>\\w+)\\s+(?P<state>active|act/lshut|suspended)"
      state_static:
        value: present

Another common use case for parsing CLI commands is to break a large command
into blocks that can parsed.  This can be done using the ``start_block`` and
``end_block`` directives to break the command into blocks that can be parsed.::

    ---
    vars:
      interface:
        name: "{{ item[0].match[0] }}"
        state: "{{ item[1].state }}"
        mode: "{{ item[2].match[0] }}"

    keys:
      interfaces:
        value: "{{ interface }}"
        start_block: "^Ethernet.*$"
        end_block: "^$"
        items:
          - "^(?P<name>Ethernet\\d\\/\\d*)"
          - "admin state is (?P<state>.+),"
          - "Port mode is (.+)"


The example above will parse the output of ``show interface`` into a list of
hashes.

The network filters also support parsing the output of a CLI command using the
TextFSM library.  To parse the CLI output with TextFSM use the following
filter::

  {{ output | parse_cli_textfsm('path/to/fsm') }}

Use of the TextFSM filter requires the TextFSM library to be installed.

.. _hash_filters:

Hashing filters
```````````````

.. versionadded:: 1.9

To get the sha1 hash of a string::

    {{ 'test1'|hash('sha1') }}

To get the md5 hash of a string::

    {{ 'test1'|hash('md5') }}

Get a string checksum::

    {{ 'test2'|checksum }}

Other hashes (platform dependent)::

    {{ 'test2'|hash('blowfish') }}

To get a sha512 password hash (random salt)::

    {{ 'passwordsaresecret'|password_hash('sha512') }}

To get a sha256 password hash with a specific salt::

    {{ 'secretpassword'|password_hash('sha256', 'mysecretsalt') }}


Hash types available depend on the master system running ansible,
'hash' depends on hashlib password_hash depends on passlib (http://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.html).

.. _combine_filter:

Combining hashes/dictionaries
`````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.0

The `combine` filter allows hashes to be merged. For example, the
following would override keys in one hash::

    {{ {'a':1, 'b':2}|combine({'b':3}) }}

The resulting hash would be::

    {'a':1, 'b':3}

The filter also accepts an optional `recursive=True` parameter to not
only override keys in the first hash, but also recurse into nested
hashes and merge their keys too

.. code-block:: jinja

    {{ {'a':{'foo':1, 'bar':2}, 'b':2}|combine({'a':{'bar':3, 'baz':4}}, recursive=True) }}

This would result in::

    {'a':{'foo':1, 'bar':3, 'baz':4}, 'b':2}

The filter can also take multiple arguments to merge::

    {{ a|combine(b, c, d) }}

In this case, keys in `d` would override those in `c`, which would
override those in `b`, and so on.

This behaviour does not depend on the value of the `hash_behaviour`
setting in `ansible.cfg`.

.. _extract_filter:

Extracting values from containers
`````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.1

The `extract` filter is used to map from a list of indices to a list of
values from a container (hash or array)::

    {{ [0,2]|map('extract', ['x','y','z'])|list }}
    {{ ['x','y']|map('extract', {'x': 42, 'y': 31})|list }}

The results of the above expressions would be::

    ['x', 'z']
    [42, 31]

The filter can take another argument::

    {{ groups['x']|map('extract', hostvars, 'ec2_ip_address')|list }}

This takes the list of hosts in group 'x', looks them up in `hostvars`,
and then looks up the `ec2_ip_address` of the result. The final result
is a list of IP addresses for the hosts in group 'x'.

The third argument to the filter can also be a list, for a recursive
lookup inside the container::

    {{ ['a']|map('extract', b, ['x','y'])|list }}

This would return a list containing the value of `b['a']['x']['y']`.

.. _comment_filter:

Comment Filter
``````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.0

The `comment` filter allows to decorate the text with a chosen comment
style. For example the following::

    {{ "Plain style (default)" | comment }}

will produce this output::

    #
    # Plain style (default)
    #

Similar way can be applied style for C (``//...``), C block
(``/*...*/``), Erlang (``%...``) and XML (``<!--...-->``)::

    {{ "C style" | comment('c') }}
    {{ "C block style" | comment('cblock') }}
    {{ "Erlang style" | comment('erlang') }}
    {{ "XML style" | comment('xml') }}

It is also possible to fully customize the comment style::

    {{ "Custom style" | comment('plain', prefix='#######\n#', postfix='#\n#######\n   ###\n    #') }}

That will create the following output:

.. code-block:: sh

    #######
    #
    # Custom style
    #
    #######
       ###
        #

The filter can also be applied to any Ansible variable. For example to
make the output of the ``ansible_managed`` variable more readable, we can
change the definition in the ``ansible.cfg`` file to this:

.. code-block:: jinja

    [defaults]

    ansible_managed = This file is managed by Ansible.%n
      template: {file}
      date: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
      user: {uid}
      host: {host}

and then use the variable with the `comment` filter::

    {{ ansible_managed | comment }}

which will produce this output:

.. code-block:: sh

    #
    # This file is managed by Ansible.
    #
    # template: /home/ansible/env/dev/ansible_managed/roles/role1/templates/test.j2
    # date: 2015-09-10 11:02:58
    # user: ansible
    # host: myhost
    #


.. _other_useful_filters:

URL Split Filter
`````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.4

The ``urlsplit`` filter extracts the fragment, hostname, netloc, password, path, port, query, scheme, and username from an URL. With no arguments, returns a dictionary of all the fields::

    {{ "http://user:password@www.acme.com:9000/dir/index.html?query=term#frament" | urlsplit('hostname') }}
    # => 'www.acme.com'

    {{ "http://user:password@www.acme.com:9000/dir/index.html?query=term#frament" | urlsplit('netloc') }}
    # => 'user:password@www.acme.com:9000'

    {{ "http://user:password@www.acme.com:9000/dir/index.html?query=term#frament" | urlsplit('username') }}
    # => 'user'

    {{ "http://user:password@www.acme.com:9000/dir/index.html?query=term#frament" | urlsplit('password') }}
    # => 'password'

    {{ "http://user:password@www.acme.com:9000/dir/index.html?query=term#frament" | urlsplit('path') }}
    # => '/dir/index.html'

    {{ "http://user:password@www.acme.com:9000/dir/index.html?query=term#frament" | urlsplit('port') }}
    # => '9000'

    {{ "http://user:password@www.acme.com:9000/dir/index.html?query=term#frament" | urlsplit('scheme') }}
    # => 'http'

    {{ "http://user:password@www.acme.com:9000/dir/index.html?query=term#frament" | urlsplit('query') }}
    # => 'query=term'

    {{ "http://user:password@www.acme.com:9000/dir/index.html?query=term#frament" | urlsplit('fragment') }}
    # => 'fragment'

    {{ "http://user:password@www.acme.com:9000/dir/index.html?query=term#frament" | urlsplit }}
    # =>
    #   {
    #       "fragment": "fragment",
    #       "hostname": "www.acme.com",
    #       "netloc": "user:password@www.acme.com:9000",
    #       "password": "password",
    #       "path": "/dir/index.html",
    #       "port": 9000,
    #       "query": "query=term",
    #       "scheme": "http",
    #       "username": "user"
    #   }


Regular Expression Filters
``````````````````````````

To search a string with a regex, use the "regex_search" filter::

    # search for "foo" in "foobar"
    {{ 'foobar' | regex_search('(foo)') }}

    # will return empty if it cannot find a match
    {{ 'ansible' | regex_search('(foobar)') }}


To search for all occurrences of regex matches, use the "regex_findall" filter::

    # Return a list of all IPv4 addresses in the string
    {{ 'Some DNS servers are 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4' | regex_findall('\b(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b') }}


To replace text in a string with regex, use the "regex_replace" filter::

    # convert "ansible" to "able"
    {{ 'ansible' | regex_replace('^a.*i(.*)$', 'a\\1') }}

    # convert "foobar" to "bar"
    {{ 'foobar' | regex_replace('^f.*o(.*)$', '\\1') }}

    # convert "localhost:80" to "localhost, 80" using named groups
    {{ 'localhost:80' | regex_replace('^(?P<host>.+):(?P<port>\\d+)$', '\\g<host>, \\g<port>') }}

    # convert "localhost:80" to "localhost"
    {{ 'localhost:80' | regex_replace(':80') }}

.. note:: Prior to ansible 2.0, if "regex_replace" filter was used with variables inside YAML arguments (as opposed to simpler 'key=value' arguments),
   then you needed to escape backreferences (e.g. ``\\1``) with 4 backslashes (``\\\\``) instead of 2 (``\\``).

.. versionadded:: 2.0

To escape special characters within a regex, use the "regex_escape" filter::

    # convert '^f.*o(.*)$' to '\^f\.\*o\(\.\*\)\$'
    {{ '^f.*o(.*)$' | regex_escape() }}

    {{ (("2016-08-14 20:00:12"|to_datetime) - ("2015-12-25"|to_datetime('%Y-%m-%d'))).seconds  }}


Combination Filters

This set of filters returns a list of combined lists.
To get permutations of a list::

    - name: give me largest permutations (order matters)
      debug: msg="{{ [1,2,3,4,5]|permutations|list }}"

    - name: give me permutations of sets of three
      debug: msg="{{ [1,2,3,4,5]|permutations(3)|list }}"

Combinations always require a set size::

    - name: give me combinations for sets of two
      debug: msg="{{ [1,2,3,4,5]|combinations(2)|list }}"


To get a list combining the elements of other lists use ``zip``::

    - name: give me list combo of two lists
      debug: msg="{{ [1,2,3,4,5]|zip(['a','b','c','d','e','f'])|list }}"

    - name: give me shortest combo of two lists
      debug: msg="{{ [1,2,3]|zip(['a','b','c','d','e','f'])|list }}"

To always exhaust all list use ``zip_longest``::

    - name: give me longest combo of three lists , fill with X
      debug: msg="{{ [1,2,3]|zip_longest(['a','b','c','d','e','f'], [21, 22, 23], fillvalue='X')|list }}"


.. versionadded:: 2.4

To format a date using a string (like with the shell date command), use the "strftime" filter::

    # Display year-month-day
    {{ '%Y-%m-%d' | strftime }}

    # Display hour:min:sec
    {{ '%H:%M:%S' | strftime }}

    # Use ansible_date_time.epoch fact
    {{ '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' | strftime(ansible_date_time.epoch) }}

    # Use arbitrary epoch value
    {{ '%Y-%m-%d' | strftime(0) }}          # => 1970-01-01
    {{ '%Y-%m-%d' | strftime(1441357287) }} # => 2015-09-04

.. note:: To get all string possibilities, check https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime

Debugging Filters
`````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.3

Use the ``type_debug`` filter to display the underlying Python type of a variable.
This can be useful in debugging in situations where you may need to know the exact
type of a variable::

    {{ myvar | type_debug }}


A few useful filters are typically added with each new Ansible release.  The development documentation shows
how to extend Ansible filters by writing your own as plugins, though in general, we encourage new ones
to be added to core so everyone can make use of them.
