Module Maintenance & Support
----------------------------

.. toctree:: :maxdepth: 1

To help identify maintainers and understand how the included modules are officially supported, each module now has associated metadata that provides additional clarity for maintenance and support.

Core
````

:doc:`Core modules are maintained by the Ansible Engineering Team<core_maintained>`.
These modules are integral to the basic foundations of the Ansible distribution.

Network
```````

:doc:`Network modules are maintained by the Ansible Network Team<network_maintained>`. Please note there are :doc:`additional networking modules<list_of_network_modules>` that are categorized as Certified or Community not maintained by Ansible.


Certified
`````````

Certified modules are part of a future planned program currently in development.

Community
`````````

:doc:`Community modules are submitted and maintained by the Ansible community<community_maintained>`.  These modules are not maintained by Ansible, and are included as a convenience.

Issue Reporting
```````````````

If you believe you have found a bug in a module and are already running the latest stable or development version of Ansible, first look at the `issue tracker in the Ansible repo <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues>`_ to see if an issue has already been filed. If not, please file one.

Should you have a question rather than a bug report, inquiries are welcome on the `ansible-project Google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/ansible-project>`_ or on Ansible's "#ansible" channel, located on irc.freenode.net.

For development-oriented topics, use the `ansible-devel Google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/ansible-devel>`_ or Ansible's #ansible and #ansible-devel channels, located on irc.freenode.net. You should also read :doc:`Community Information & Contributing <community>`, :doc:`Testing Ansible <dev_guide/testing>`, and :doc:`Developing Modules <dev_guide/developing_modules>`.

The modules are hosted on GitHub in a subdirectory of the `Ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/lib/ansible/modules>`_ repo.

NOTE: If you have a Red Hat Ansible Engine product subscription, please follow the standard issue reporting process via the Red Hat Customer Portal.
