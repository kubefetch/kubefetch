Sanity Tests Â» no-underscore-variable
=====================================

In the future, Ansible may use the identifier ``_`` to internationalize its
message strings.  To be ready for that, we need to make sure that there are
no conflicting identifiers defined in the code base.

In common practice, ``_`` is frequently used as a dummy variable (a variable
to receive a value from a function where the value is useless and never used).
In Ansible, we're using the identifier ``dummy`` for this purpose instead.

Example of unfixed code:

.. code-block:: python

    for _ in range(0, retries):
        success = retry_thing()
        if success:
            break

Example of fixed code:

.. code-block:: python

    for dummy in range(0, retries):
        success = retry_thing()
        if success:
            break
