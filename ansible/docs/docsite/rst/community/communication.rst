Mailing List Information
========================

Ansible has several mailing lists.  Your first post to the mailing list will be moderated (to reduce spam), so please allow up to a day or so for your first post to appear.

`Ansible Project List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project>`_ is for sharing Ansible tips, answering questions, and general user discussion.

`Ansible Development List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel>`_ is for learning how to develop on Ansible, asking about prospective feature design, or discussions about extending ansible or features in progress.

`Ansible Announce list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-announce>`_ is a read-only list that shares information about new releases of Ansible, and also rare infrequent event information, such as announcements about an upcoming AnsibleFest, which is our official conference series.

`Ansible Container List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-container>`_ is for users and developers of the Ansible Container project.

`Ansible Lockdown List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-lockdown>`_ is for all things related to Ansible Lockdown projects, including DISA STIG automation and CIS Benchmarks.
