## 2.4.5 "Dancing Days" - 2018-06-21

### Bugfixes

* **Security Fix** - Some connection exceptions would cause no_log specified on
  a task to be ignored.  If this happened, the task information, including any
  private information could have been displayed to stdout and (if enabled, not
  the default) logged to a log file specified in ansible.cfg''s log_path.
  Additionally, sites which redirected stdout from ansible runs to a log file
  may have stored that private information onto disk that way as well.
  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41414)

  deleting it when dealing with multiple files
  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/37964)

<a id="2.4"></a>

## 2.4 "Dancing Days" - 2017-09-19

### Major Changes

* Support for Python-2.4 and Python-2.5 on the managed system's side was dropped. If you need to manage a system that ships with Python-2.4 or Python-2.5, you'll need to install Python-2.6 or better on the managed system or run Ansible-2.3 until you can upgrade the system.
* New import/include keywords to replace the old bare `include` directives. The use of `static: {yes|no}` on such includes is now deprecated.
    - Using `import_*` (`import_playbook`, `import_tasks`, `import_role`) directives are static.
    - Using `include_*` (`include_tasks`, `include_role`) directives are dynamic.
  This is done to avoid collisions and possible security issues as facts come from the remote targets and they might be compromised.
* New `order` play level keyword that allows the user to change the order in which Ansible processes hosts when dispatching tasks.
* Users can now set group merge priority for groups of the same depth (parent child relationship), using the new `ansible_group_priority` variable, when values are the same or don't exist it will fallback to the previous sorting by name'.
* Inventory has been revamped:
  - Inventory classes have been split to allow for better management and deduplication
  - Logic that each inventory source duplicated is now common and pushed up to reconciliation
  - VariableManager has been updated for better interaction with inventory
  - Updated CLI with helper method to initialize base objects for plays
  - New inventory plugins for creating inventory
  - Old inventory formats are still supported via plugins
  - Inline host_list is also an inventory plugin, an example alternative `advanced_host_list` is also provided (it supports ranges)
  - New configuration option to list enabled plugins and precedence order `[inventory]enable_plugins` in ansible.cfg
  - vars_plugins have been reworked, they are now run from Vars manager and API has changed (need docs)
  - Loading group_vars/host_vars is now a vars plugin and can be overridden
  - It is now possible to specify mulitple inventory sources in the command line (-i /etc/hosts1 -i /opt/hosts2)
  - Inventory plugins can use the cache plugin (i.e. virtualbox) and is affected by `meta: refresh_inventory`
  - Group variable precedence is now configurable via new 'precedence' option in ansible.cfg (needs docs)
  - Improved warnings and error messages across the board
* Configuration has been changed from a hardcoded listing in the constants module to dynamically loaded from yaml definitions
  - Also added an ansible-config CLI to allow for listing config options and dumping current config (including origin)
  - TODO: build upon this to add many features detailed in ansible-config proposal https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/35
* Windows modules now support the use of multiple shared module_utils files in the form of Powershell modules (.psm1), via `#Requires -Module Ansible.ModuleUtils.Whatever.psm1`
* Python module argument_spec now supports custom validation logic by accepting a callable as the `type` argument.
* Windows become_method: runas now works across all authtypes and will auto-elevate under UAC if WinRM user has "Act as part of the operating system" privilege
* Do not escape backslashes in the template lookup plugin to mirror what the template module does
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/26397

### Deprecations
* The behaviour when specifying `--tags` (or `--skip-tags`) multiple times on the command line
  has changed so that the tags are merged together by default.  See the
  documentation for how to temporarily use the old behaviour if needed:
  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#merge-multiple-cli-tags
* The `fetch` module's `validate_md5` parameter has been deprecated and will be
  removed in 2.8.  If you wish to disable post-validation of the downloaded
  file, use validate_checksum instead.
* Those using ansible as a library should note that the `ansible.vars.unsafe_proxy`
  module is deprecated and slated to go away in 2.8.  The functionality has been
  moved to `ansible.utils.unsafe_proxy` to avoid a circular import.
* The win_get_url module has the dictionary 'win_get_url' in its results deprecated,
  its content is now also available directly in the resulting output, like other modules.
* previouslly deprecated 'hostfile' config settings have been 're-deprecated' as before the code did not warn about deprecated configuration settings
, but it does now.

#### Deprecated Modules (to be removed in 2.8):
* azure: use M(azure_rm_virtualmachine) instead
* cs_nic: replaced by cs_instance_nic_secondaryip, also see new module cs_instance_nic for managing nics
* ec2_facts: replaced by ec2_metadata_facts
* ec2_remote_facts: replaced by ec2_instance_facts
* panos_address: use M(panos_object) instead
* panos_nat_policy: use M(panos_nat_rule) instead
* panos_security_policy: use M(panos_security_rule) instead
* panos_service: use M(panos_object) instead
* s3: replaced by aws_s3
* win_msi: use M(win_package) instead

#### Removed Modules (previously deprecated):
* eos_template: use eos_config instead
* ios_template: use ios_config instead
* iosxr_template: use iosxr_config instead
* junos_template: use junos_config instead
* nxos_template: use nxos_config instead
* openswitch
* ops_template: use ops_config instead


### Minor Changes
* Now deprecated configuration options issue warnings when set.
* Removed unused and deprecated config option `pattern`
* Updated the copy of six bundled for modules to use from 1.4.1 to 1.10.0
* The `inventory_dir` var is not a global anymore, as we now allow multiple inventory sources, it is now host dependant.
  This means it cannot be used wherever host vars are not permitted, for example in task/handler names.
* Fixed a cornercase with ini inventory vars.  Previously, if an inventory var
  was a quoted string with hash marks ("#") in it then the parsed string
  included the quotes.  Now the string will not be quoted.  Previously, if the
  quoting ended before the string finished and then the hash mark appeared, the
  hash mark was included as part of the string.  Now it is treated as
  a trailing comment:

      # Before:
      var1="string#comment"   ===>  var1: "\"string#comment\""
      var1="string" #comment  ===>  var1: "\"string\" #comment"
      # After:
      var1="string#comment"   ===>  var1: "string#comment"
      var1="string" #comment  ===>  var1: "string"

  The new behaviour mirrors how the variables would appear if there was no hash
  mark in the string.
* As of 2.4.0, the fetch module fails if there are errors reading the remote file.
  Use `ignore_errors` or `failed_when` in playbooks if you wish to ignore errors.
* Experimentally added pmrun become method.
* Enable the docker connection plugin to use su as a become method
* Add an encoding parameter for the replace module so that it can operate on non-utf-8 files
* By default, Ansible now uses the cryptography module to implement vault instead of the older pycrypto module.
* Changed task state resulting from both `rc` and `failed` fields returned, 'rc' no longer overrides 'failed'. Test plugins have also been updated accordingly.
* The win_unzip module no longer includes dictionary 'win_unzip' in its results,
  the content is now directly in the resulting output, like pretty much every other module.
* Rewrite of the copy module so that it handles cornercases with symbolic links
  and empty directories.  The copy module has a new parameter, `local_follow`
  which controls how links on the source system are treated. (The older
  parameter, follow is for links on the remote system.)
* Update the handling of symbolic file permissions in file-related mode
  parameters to deal with multiple operators.  For instance, `mode='u=rw+x-X'` to
  set the execute bit on directories, remove it from filea, and set read-write
  on both is now supported
* Added better cookie parsing to fetch_url/open_url. Cookies are now in a dictionary named `cookies`
  in the fetch_url result. Anything using `open_url` directly can pass a cookie object as a named arg
  (`cookies`), and then parse/format the cookies in the result.
* The bundled copy of six in lib/ansible/module_utils/six is now used
  unconditionally.  The code to fallback on a system six interfered with static
  analysis of the code so the cost of using the fallback code became too high.
  Distributions which wish to unbundle may do so by replacing the bundled six
  in ansible/module_utils/six/__init__.py.  Six is tricky to unbundle, however,
  so they may want to base their efforts off the code we were using:
    * https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/2fff690caab6a1c6a81973f704be3fbd0bde2c2f/lib/ansible/module_utils/six/__init__.py
* Update ipaddr Jinja filters to replace existing non RFC compliant ones. Added additional filters for easier use
  of handling IP addresses. (PR# 26566)
* datetime filter updated to use default format of datetime.datetime (ISO8601)
* The junit plugin now has an option to report a junit test failure on changes for idempotent testing.
* New 'diff' keyword allows setting diff mode on playbook objects, overriding command line option and config.
* New config settings for inventory to:
	- control inventory plugins used
    - extensions of files to ignore when using inventory directory
	- patterns of flies to ignore when using inventory directory
	- option to toggle failed inventory source parsing between an error or a warning
* More fixes for Python 3 across the code base.
* win_shell and win_command modules now properly preserve quoted arguments passed on the command-line. Tasks that attempted to work around the issue by adding extra quotes/escaping may need to be reworked. See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/23019 for additional detail.
* All configuration paths are now relative to the `ansible.cfg` file used.
* By user request, a 'configuration macro' (``CWD``) is available to force configured paths to be relative to the current working directory. Please note that this is unsafe and not recommended.

### Module Notes
- By mistake, an early version of elb_classic_lb, elb_instance, and elb_classic_lb_facts modules
  were released and marked as stableinterface.  These are now marked as preview in 2.4.1 and their
  parameters and return values may change in 2.5.0.  Part of this mistake included deprecating the
  ec2_elb_lb, ec2_lb, and ec2_elb_facts modules prematurely.  These modules won't be deprecated
  until the replacements above have a stableinterface and the erroneous deprecation has been fixed
  in 2.4.1.
- The docker_container module has gained a new option, `working_dir` which allows
  specifying the working directory for the command being run in the image.
- The ec2_win_password module now requires the cryptography python module be installed to run
- The stat module added a field, lnk_target.  When the file being stated is
  a symlink, lnk_target will contain the target of the link.  This differs from
  lnk_source when the target is specified relative to the symlink.  In this
  case, lnk_target will remain relative while lnk_source will be expanded to an
  absolute path.
- The archive module has a new parameter exclude_path which lists paths to exclude from the archive
- The yum module has a new parameter security which limits state=latest to security updates
- The template module gained a follow parameter to match with copy and file.
  Like those modules, template defaults this parameter to False.  Previously,
  template hardcoded this to true.
- Added a new parameter to command module that lets users specify data to pipe
  into the command's stdin.
- The azure_rm modules now accept a `cloud_environment` arg to access regional and private clouds.
- The azure_rm modules and inventory script now require at least version 2.0.0 of the Azure Python SDK.

## 2.3 "Ramble On" - 2017-04-12

Moving to Ansible 2.3 guide http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/porting_guide_2.3.html

### Major Changes
* Documented and renamed the previously released 'single var vaulting' feature, allowing user to use vault encryption for single variables in a normal YAML vars file.
* Allow module_utils for custom modules to be placed in site-specific directories and shipped in roles
* On platforms that support it, use more modern system polling API instead of select in the ssh connection plugin.
  This removes one limitation on how many parallel forks are feasible on these systems.
* Windows/WinRM supports (experimental) become method "runas" to run modules and scripts as a different user, and to transparently access network resources.
* The WinRM connection plugin now uses pipelining when executing modules, resulting in significantly faster execution for small tasks.
* The WinRM connection plugin can now manage Kerberos tickets automatically when `ansible_winrm_transport=kerberos` and `ansible_user`/`ansible_password` are specified.
* Refactored/standardized most Windows modules, adding check-mode and diff support where possible.
* Extended Windows module API with parameter-type support, helper functions. (i.e. Expand-Environment, Add-Warning, Add-DeprecatationWarning)
* restructured how async works to allow it to apply to action plugins that choose to support it.

### Minor Changes
* The version and release facts for OpenBSD hosts were reversed.
  This has been changed so that version has the numeric portion and release has the name of the release.
* removed 'package' from default squash actions as not all package managers support it and it creates errors when using loops,
  any user can add back via config options if they don't use those package managers or otherwise avoid the errors.
* Blocks can now have a `name` field, to aid in playbook readability.
* default strategy is now configurable via ansible.cfg or environment variable.
* Added 'ansible_playbook_python' which contains 'current python executable', it can be blank in some cases in which Ansible is not invoked via the standard CLI (sys.executable limitation).
* Added 'metadata' to modules to enable classification
* ansible-doc now displays path to module and existing 'metadata'
* added optional 'piped' transfer method to ssh plugin for when scp and sftp are missing, ssh plugin is also now 'smarter' when using these options
* default controlpersist path is now a custom hash of host-port-user to avoid the socket path length errors for long hostnames
* Various fixes for Python3 compatibility
* Fixed issues with inventory formats not handling 'all' and 'ungrouped' in an uniform way.
* 'service' tasks can now use async again, we had lost this capability when changed into an action plugin.
* made any_errors_fatal inheritable from play to task and all other objects in between.
* many small performance improvements in inventory and variable handling and in task execution.
* Added a retry class to the ec2_asg module since customers were running into throttling errors (AWSRetry is a solution for modules using boto3 which isn't applicable here).

### Deprecations
* Specifying --tags (or --skip-tags) multiple times on the command line
  currently leads to the last one overriding all the previous ones. This behaviour is deprecated.
  In the future, if you specify --tags multiple times the tags will be merged together.
  From now on, using --tags multiple times on one command line will emit a deprecation warning.
  Setting the merge_multiple_cli_tags option to True in the ansible.cfg file will enable the new behaviour.
  In 2.4, the default will be to merge and you can enable the old overwriting behaviour via the config option.
  In 2.5, multiple --tags options will be merged with no way to go back to the old behaviour.

* Modules (scheduled for removal in 2.5)
  * ec2_vpc
  * cl_bond
  * cl_bridge
  * cl_img_install
  * cl_interface
  * cl_interface_policy
  * cl_license
  * cl_ports
  * nxos_mtu, use nxos_system instead

#### New: Callbacks

- dense: minimal stdout output with fallback to default when verbose

#### New: lookups

- keyring: allows getting password from the 'controller' system's keyrings
- chef_databag: allows querying Chef Databags via pychef library

#### New: cache

- pickle (uses python's own serializer)
- yaml

#### New: inventory scripts
- oVirt/RHV

#### New: filters
- combinations
- permutations
- zip
- zip_longest


### Module Notes
- AWS lambda: previously ignored changes that only affected one parameter. Existing deployments may have outstanding changes that this bugfix will apply.
- oVirt/RHV: Added support for 4.1 features and the following:
  * data centers, clusters, hosts, storage domains and networks management.
  * hosts and virtual machines affinity groups and labels.
  * users, groups and permissions management.
  * Improved virtual machines and disks management.
- Mount: Some fixes so bind mounts are not mounted each time the playbook runs.

## 2.2.1 "The Battle of Evermore" - 2017-01-16

### Major Changes

* Security fix for CVE-2016-9587 - An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server as the user and group Ansible is running as.

### Minor Changes

* Fixes a bug where undefined variables in with_* loops would cause a task failure even if the when condition would cause the task to be skipped.
* Fixed a bug related to roles where in certain situations a role may be run more than once despite not allowing duplicates.
* Fixed some additional bugs related to atomic_move for modules.
* Fixes multiple bugs related to field/attribute inheritance in nested blocks and includes, as well as task iteration logic during failures.
* Fixed pip installing packages into virtualenvs using the system pip instead of the virtualenv pip.
* Fixed dnf on systems with dnf-2.0.x (some changes in the API).
* Fixed traceback with dnf install of groups.
* Fixes a bug in which include_vars was not working with failed_when.
* Fix for include_vars only loading files with .yml, .yaml, and .json extensions.  This was only supposed to apply to loading a directory of vars files.
* Fixes several bugs related to properly incrementing the failed count in the host statistics.
* Fixes a bug with listening handlers which did not specify a `name` field.
* Fixes a bug with the `play_hosts` internal variable, so that it properly reflects the current list of hosts.
* Fixes a bug related to the v2_playbook_on_start callback method and legacy (v1) plugins.
* Fixes an openssh related process exit race condition, related to the fact that connections using ControlPersist do not close stderr.
* Improvements and fixes to OpenBSD fact gathering.
* Updated `make deb` to use pbuilder. Use `make local_deb` for the previous non-pbuilder build.
* Fixed Windows async to avoid blocking due to handle inheritance.
* Fixed bugs in the mount module on older Linux kernels and BSDs
* Various minor fixes for Python 3
* Inserted some checks for jinja2-2.9, which can cause some issues with Ansible currently.

<a id="2.2"></a>

## 2.2 "The Battle of Evermore" - 2016-11-01

### Major Changes:

* Added the `listen` feature for modules. This feature allows tasks to more easily notify multiple handlers, as well as making it easier for handlers from decoupled roles to be notified.
* Major performance improvements.
* Added support for binary modules
* Added the ability to specify serial batches as a list (`serial: [1, 5, 10]`), which allows for so-called "canary" actions in one play.
* Fixed 'local type' plugins and actions to have a more predictable relative path. Fixes a regression of 1.9 (PR #16805). Existing users of 2.x will need to adjust related tasks.
* `meta` tasks can now use conditionals.
* `raw` now returns `changed: true` to be consistent with shell/command/script modules. Add `changed_when: false` to `raw` tasks to restore the pre-2.2 behavior if necessary.
* New privilege escalation become method `ksu`
* Windows `async:` support for long-running or background tasks.
* Windows `environment:` support for setting module environment vars in play/task.
* Added a new `meta` option: `end_play`, which can be used to skip to the end of a play.
* roles can now be included in the middle of a task list via the new `include_role` module, this also allows for making the role import 'loopable' and/or conditional.
* The service module has been changed to use system specific modules if they exist and fall back to the old service module if they cannot be found or detected.
* Add ability to specify what ssh client binary to use on the controller.  This
  can be configured via ssh_executable in the ansible config file or by setting
  ansible_ssh_executable as an inventory variable if different ones are needed
  for different hosts.
* Windows:
  * several facts were modified or renamed for consistency with their Unix counterparts, and many new facts were added. If your playbooks rely on any of the following keys, please ensure they are using the correct key names and/or values:
    - ansible_date_time.date (changed to use yyyy-mm-dd format instead of default system-locale format)
    - ansible_date_time.iso8601 (changed to UTC instead of local time)
    - ansible_distribution (now uses OS caption string, e.g.: "Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard", version is still available on ansible_distribution_version)
    - ansible_totalmem (renamed to ansible_memtotal_mb, units changed to MB instead of bytes)
  * `async:` support for long-running or background tasks.
  * `environment:` support for setting module environment vars in play/task.
* Tech Preview: Work has been done to get Ansible running under Python3.  This work is not complete enough to depend upon in production environments but it is enough to begin testing it.
  * Most of the controller side should now work.  Users should be able to run python3 /usr/bin/ansible and python3 /usr/bin/ansible-playbook and have core features of ansible work.
  * A few of the most essential modules have been audited and are known to work.  Others work out of the box.
  * We are using unit and integration tests to help us port code and not regress later.  Even if you are not familiar with python you can still help by contributing integration tests (just ansible roles) that exercise more of the code to make sure it continues to run on both Python2 and Python3.
  * scp_if_ssh now supports True, False and "smart". "smart" is the default and will retry failed sftp transfers with scp.
* Network:
  * Refactored all network modules to remove duplicate code and take advantage of Ansiballz implementation
  * All functionality from *_template network modules have been combined into *_config module
  * Network *_command modules not longer allow configuration mode statements

#### New Callbacks
* foreman

### Minor Changes
* now -vvv shows exact path from which 'currently executing module' was picked up from.
* loop_control now has a label option to allow fine grained control what gets displayed per item
* loop_control now has a pause option to allow pausing for N seconds between loop iterations of a task.
* New privilege escalation become method `ksu`
* `raw` now returns `changed: true` to be consistent with shell/command/script modules. Add `changed_when: false` to `raw` tasks to restore the pre-2.2 behavior if necessary.
* removed previously deprecated ';' as host list separator.
* Only check if the default ssh client supports ControlPersist once instead of once for each host + task combination.
* Fix a problem with the pip module updating the python pip package itself.
* ansible_play_hosts is a new magic variable to provide a list of hosts in scope for the current play. Unlike play_hosts it is not subject to the 'serial' keyword.
* ansible_play_batch is a new magic variable meant to substitute the current play_hosts.

### For custom front ends using the API
* ansible.parsing.vault:
  * VaultLib.is_encrypted() has been deprecated.  It will be removed in 2.4.
    Use ansible.parsing.vault.is_encrypted() instead
  * VaultFile has been removed. This unfinished code was never used inside of
    Ansible.  The feature it was intended to support has now been implemented
    without using this.
  * VaultAES, the older, insecure encrypted format that debuted in Ansible-1.5
    and was replaced by VaultAES256 less than a week later, now has a deprecation
    warning.  **It will be removed in 2.3**.  In the unlikely event that you
    wrote a vault file in that 1 week window and have never modified the file
    since (ansible-vault automatically re-encrypts the file using VaultAES256
    whenever it is written to but not read), run ``ansible-vault rekey
    [filename]`` to move to VaultAES256.

### Removed Deprecated
* ';' as host list separator.
* with\_ 'bare variable' handling, now loop items must always be templated `{{ }}` or they will be considered as plain strings.
* skipping task on 'missing attribute' in loop variable, now in a loop an undefined attribute will return an error instead of skipping the task.
* skipping on undefined variables in loop, now loops will have to define a variable or use `|default` to avoid errors.

### Deprecations
Notice given that the following will be removed in Ansible 2.4:
* Modules
  * eos_template
  * ios_template
  * iosxr_template
  * junos_template
  * nxos_template
  * ops_template

<a id="2.1.4"></a>

## 2.1.4 "The Song Remains the Same" - 2017-01-16

* Security fix for CVE-2016-9587 - An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server as the user and group Ansible is running as.
* Fixed a bug with conditionals in loops, where undefined variables and other errors will defer raising the error until the conditional has been evaluated.
* Added a version check for jinja2-2.9, which does not fully work with Ansible currently.

<a id="2.1.3"></a>

## 2.1.3 "The Song Remains the Same" - 2016-11-04

* Security fix for CVE-2016-8628 - Command injection by compromised server via fact variables. In some situations, facts returned by modules could overwrite connection-based facts or some other special variables, leading to injected commands running on the Ansible controller as the user running Ansible (or via escalated permissions).
* Security fix for CVE-2016-8614 - apt_key module not properly validating keys in some situations.

### Minor Changes:
* The subversion module from core now marks its password parameter as no_log so
  the password is obscured when logging.
* The postgresql_lang and postgresql_ext modules from extras now mark
  login_password as no_log so the password is obscured when logging.
* Fixed several bugs related to locating files relative to role/playbook directories.
* Fixed a bug in the way hosts were tested for failed states, resulting in incorrectly skipped block sessions.
* Fixed a bug in the way our custom JSON encoder is used for the `to_json*` filters.
* Fixed some bugs related to the use of non-ascii characters in become passwords.
* Fixed a bug with Azure modules which may be using the latest rc6 library.
* Backported some docker_common fixes.

<a id="2.1.2"></a>

## 2.1.2 "The Song Remains the Same" - 2016-09-29

### Minor Changes
* Fixed a bug related to creation of retry files (#17456)
* Fixed a bug in the way include params are used when an include task is dynamic (#17064)
* Fixed a bug related to including blocks in an include task (#15963)
* Fixed a bug related to the use of hostvars internally when creating the connection plugin. This prevents things like variables using lookups from being evaluated unnecessarily (#17024)
* Fixed a bug where using a variable containing a list for the `hosts` of a play resulted in an list of lists (#16583)
* Fixed a bug where integer values would cause an error if a module param was of type `float` (no issue)
* Fixed a bug with net_template failing if src was not specified (#17726)
* Fixed a bug in "ansible-galaxy import" (#17417)
* Fixed a bug in which INI files incorrectly treated a hosts range as a section header (#15331)
* Fixed a bug in which the max_fail_percentage calculation erroneously caused a series of plays to stop executing (#15954)
* Fixed a bug in which the task names were not properly templated (#16295)
* Fixed a bug causing "squashed" loops (ie. yum, apt) to incorrectly report results (ansible-modules-core#4214)
* Fixed several bugs related to includes:
  - when including statically, make sure that all parents were also included statically (issue #16990)
  - properly resolve nested static include paths
  - print a message when a file is statically included
* Fixed a bug in which module params expected to be float types were not converted from integers (only strings) (#17325)
* Fixed a bug introduced by static includes in 2.1, which prevented notifications from going to the "top level" handler name.
* Fixed a bug where a group_vars or host_vars directory in the current working directory would be used (and would take precedence) over those in the inventory and/or playbook directory.
* Fixed a bug which could occur when the result of an async task did not parse as valid JSON.
* (re)-allowed the use of ansible_python_interpreter lines with more than one argument.
* Fixed several bugs related to the creation of the implicit localhost in inventory.
* Fixed a bug related to an unspecified number of retries when using until.
* Fixed a race-condition bug when creating temp directories before the worker process is forked.
* Fix a bug with async's poll keyword not making use of ansible_python_interpreter to run (and thus breaking when /usr/bin/python is not present on the remote machine.)
* Fix a bug where hosts that started with a range in inventory were being treated as an invalid section header.

Module fixes:
* Fixed a bug where the temporary CA files created by the module helper code were not being deleted properly in some situations (#17073)
* Fixed many bugs in the unarchive module
* Fixes for module ec2:
  - Fixed a bug related to source_dest_check when used with non-vpc instances (core#3243)
  - Fixed a bug in ec2 where instances were not powering of when referenced via tags only (core#4765)
  - Fixed a bug where instances with multiple interfaces were not powering up/down correctly (core#3234)
* Fixes for module get_url:
  - Fixed a bug in get_url module to force a download if there is a checksum mismatch regardless of the last modified time (core#4262)
  - Fixed a bug in get_url module to properly process FTP results (core#3661 and core#4601)
* Fixed a bug in win_user related to users with disabled accounts/expired passwords (core#4369)
* ini_file:
  - Fixed a bug where option lines are now inserted before blank lines.
  - Fixed a bug where leading whitespace prevented matches on options.
* Fixed a bug in iam_cert when dup_ok is used as a string.
* Fixed a bug in postgresql_db related to the changed logic when state=absent.
* Fixed a bug where single_transaction and quick were not passed into db_dump for the mysql_db module.
* Fixed a bug where the fetch module was not idempotent when retrieving the target of a symlink.
* Many minor fixes for bugs in extras modules.

### Deprecations

* Deprecated the use of `_fixup_perms`. Use `_fixup_perms2` instead.
  This change only impacts custom action plugins using `_fixup_perms`.

### Incompatible Changes

* Use of `_fixup_perms` with `recursive=True` (the default) is no longer supported.
  Custom action plugins using `_fixup_perms` will require changes unless they already use `recursive=False`.
  Use `_fixup_perms2` if support for previous releases is not required.
  Otherwise use `_fixup_perms` with `recursive=False`.

<a id="2.1"></a>

## 2.1 "The Song Remains the Same"

### Major Changes:

* Official support for the networking modules, originally available in 2.0 as a tech preview.
* Refactored and expanded support for Docker with new modules and many improvements to existing modules, as well as a new Kubernetes module.
* Added new modules for Azure (see below for the full list)
* Added the ability to specify includes as "static" (either through a configuration option or on a per-include basis). When includes are static,
  they are loaded at compile time and cannot contain dynamic features like loops.
* Added a new strategy `debug`, which allows per-task debugging of playbooks, for more details see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_debugger.html
* Added a new option for tasks: `loop_control`. This currently only supports one option - `loop_var`, which allows a different loop variable from `item` to be used.
* Added the ability to filter facts returned by the fact gathering setup step using the `gather_subset` option on the play or in the ansible.cfg configuration file.
  See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#gathering for details on the format of the option.
* Added the ability to send per-item callbacks, rather than a batch update (this more closely resembles the behavior of Ansible 1.x).
* Added facility for modules to send back 'diff' for display when ansible is called with --diff, updated several modules to return this info
* Added ansible-console tool, a REPL shell that allows running adhoc tasks against a chosen inventory (based on  https://github.com/dominis/ansible-shell)
* Added two new variables, which are set when the `rescue` portion of a `block` is started:
  - `ansible_failed_task`, which contains the serialized version of the failed task.
  - `ansible_failed_result`, which contains the result of the failed task.
* New meta action, `meta: clear_host_errors` which will clear any hosts which were marked as failed (but not unreachable hosts).
* New meta action, `meta: clear_facts` which will remove existing facts for the current host from current memory and facts cache.
* copy module can now transparently use a vaulted file as source, if vault passwords were provided it will decrypt and copy on the fly.
* The way new-style python modules (which include all of the non-windows modules shipped with Ansible) are assembled before execution on the remote machine has been changed. The new way stays closer to how python imports modules which will make it easier to write modules which rely heavily on shared code.
* Reduce the situations in which a module can end up as world readable.  For details, see: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/become.html#becoming-an-unprivileged-user
* Re-implemented the retry file feature, which had been left out of 2.0 (fix was backported to 2.0.1 originally).
* Improved winrm argument validation and feature sniffing (for upcoming pywinrm NTLM support).
* Improved winrm error handling: basic parsing of stderr from CLIXML stream.

#### New Callbacks
* actionable (only shows changed and failed)
* slack
* json

#### New Tests
* issubset

#### New Inventory scripts:
* brook
* rackhd
* azure_rm

### Minor Changes:

* Added support for pipelining mode to more connection plugins, which helps prevent
  module data from being written to disk.
* Added a new '!unsafe' YAML decorator, which can be used in playbooks to ensure a
  string is not templated. For example: `foo: !unsafe "Don't template {{me}}"`.
* Callbacks now have access to the options with which the CLI was called
* Debug now has verbosity option to control when to display by matching number of -v in command line
* Modules now get verbosity, diff and other flags as passed to ansible
* Mount facts now also show 'network mounts' that use the pattern `<host>:/<mount>`
* Plugins are now sorted before loading.  This means, for instance, if you want
  two custom callback plugins to run in a certain order you can name them
  10-first-callback.py and 20-second-callback.py.
* Added (alpha) Centirfy's dzdo as another become meethod (privilege escalation)

### Deprecations:

* Deprecated the use of "bare" variables in loops (ie. `with_items: foo`, where `foo` is a variable).
  The full jinja2 variable syntax of `{{foo}}` should always be used instead. This warning will be removed
  completely in 2.3, after which time it will be an error.
* play_hosts magic variable, use ansible_play_batch or ansible_play_hosts instead.

<a id="2.0.2"></a>

## 2.0.2 "Over the Hills and Far Away"

* Backport of the 2.1 feature to ensure per-item callbacks are sent as they occur,
  rather than all at once at the end of the task.
* Fixed bugs related to the iteration of tasks when certain combinations of roles,
  blocks, and includes were used, especially when handling errors in rescue/always
  portions of blocks.
* Fixed handling of redirects in our helper code, and ported the uri module to use
  this helper code. This removes the httplib dependency for this module while fixing
  some bugs related to redirects and SSL certs.
* Fixed some bugs related to the incorrect creation of extra temp directories for
  uploading files, which were not cleaned up properly.
* Improved error reporting in certain situations, to provide more information such as
  the playbook file/line.
* Fixed a bug related to the variable precedence of role parameters, especially when
  a role may be used both as a dependency of a role and directly by itself within the
  same play.
* Fixed some bugs in the 2.0 implementation of do/until.
* Fixed some bugs related to run_once:
  - Ensure that all hosts are marked as failed if a task marked as run_once fails.
  - Show a warning when using the free strategy when a run_once task is encountered, as
    there is no way for the free strategy to guarantee the task is not run more than once.
* Fixed a bug where the assemble module was not honoring check mode in some situations.
* Fixed a bug related to delegate_to, where we were incorrectly using variables from
  the inventory host rather than the delegated-to host.
* The 'package' meta-module now properly squashes items down to a single execution (as the
  apt/yum/other package modules do).
* Fixed a bug related to the ansible-galaxy CLI command dealing with paged results from
  the Galaxy server.
* Pipelining support is now available for the local and jail connection plugins, which is
  useful for users who do not wish to have temp files/directories created when running
  tasks with these connection types.
* Improvements in support for additional shell types.
* Improvements in the code which is used to calculate checksums for remote files.
* Some speed ups and bug fixes related to the variable merging code.
* Workaround bug in python subprocess on El Capitan that was making vault fail
  when attempting to encrypt a file
* Fix lxc_container module having predictable temp file names and setting file
  permissions on the temporary file too leniently on a temporary file that was
  executed as a script.  Addresses CVE-2016-3096
* Fix a bug in the uri module where setting headers via module params that
  start with `HEADER_` were causing a traceback.
* Fix bug in the free strategy that was causing it to synchronize its workers
  after every task (making it a lot more like linear than it should have been).

<a id="2.0.1"></a>

## 2.0.1 "Over the Hills and Far Away"

* Fixes a major compatibility break in the synchronize module shipped with
  2.0.0.x.  That version of synchronize ran sudo on the controller prior to
  running rsync.  In 1.9.x and previous, sudo was run on the host that rsync
  connected to.  2.0.1 restores the 1.9.x behaviour.
* Additionally, several other problems with where synchronize chose to run when
  combined with delegate_to were fixed.  In particular, if a playbook targetted
  localhost and then delegated_to a remote host the prior behavior (in 1.9.x
  and 2.0.0.x) was to copy files between the src and destination directories on
  the delegated host.  This has now been fixed to copy between localhost and
  the delegated host.
* Fix a regression where synchronize was unable to deal with unicode paths.
* Fix a regression where synchronize deals with inventory hosts that use
  localhost but with an alternate port.
* Fixes a regression where the retry files feature was not implemented.
* Fixes a regression where the any_errors_fatal option was implemented in 2.0
  incorrectly, and also adds a feature where any_errors_fatal can be set at
  the block level.
* Fix tracebacks when playbooks or ansible itself were located in directories
  with unicode characters.
* Fix bug when sending unicode characters to an external pager for display.
* Fix a bug with squashing loops for special modules (mostly package managers).
  The optimization was squashing when the loop did not apply to the selection
  of packages.  This has now been fixed.
* Temp files created when using vault are now "shredded" using the unix shred
  program which overwrites the file with random data.
* Some fixes to cloudstack modules for case sensitivity
* Fix non-newstyle modules (non-python modules and old-style modules) to
  disabled pipelining.
* Fix fetch module failing even if fail_on_missing is set to False
* Fix for cornercase when local connections, sudo, and raw were used together.
* Fix dnf module to remove dependent packages when state=absent is specified.
  This was a feature of the 1.9.x version that was left out by mistake when the
  module was rewritten for 2.0.
* Fix bugs with non-english locales in yum, git, and apt modules
* Fix a bug with the dnf module where state=latest could only upgrade, not install.
* Fix to make implicit fact gathering task correctly inherit settings from play,
  this might cause an error if settings environment on play depending on 'ansible_env'
  which was previouslly ignored

## 2.0 "Over the Hills and Far Away" - Jan 12, 2016

### Major Changes:

* Releases are now named after Led Zeppelin songs, 1.9 will be the last Van Halen named release.
* The new block/rescue/always directives allow for making task blocks and exception-like semantics
* New strategy plugins (e.g. `free`) allow control over the flow of task execution per play. The default (`linear`) will be the same as before.
* Improved error handling, with more detailed parser messages. General exception handling and display has been revamped.
* Task includes are now evaluated during execution, allowing more dynamic includes and options. Play includes are unchanged both still use the `include` directive.
* "with\_<lookup>" loops can now be used with task includes since they are dynamic.
* Callback, connection, cache and lookup plugin APIs have changed. Existing plugins might require modification to work with the new versions.
* Callbacks are now shipped in the active directory and don't need to be copied, just whitelisted in ansible.cfg.
* Many API changes. Those integrating directly with Ansible's API will encounter breaking changes, but the new API is much easier to use and test.
* Settings are now more inheritable; what you set at play, block or role will be automatically inherited by the contained tasks.
  This allows for new features to automatically be settable at all levels, previously we had to manually code this.
* Vars are now settable at play, block, role and task level with the `vars` directive and scoped to the tasks contained.
* Template code now retains types for bools and numbers instead of turning them into strings.
  If you need the old behaviour, quote the value and it will get passed around as a string
* Empty variables and variables set to null in yaml will no longer be converted to empty strings.  They will retain the value of `None`.
  To go back to the old behaviour, you can override the `null_representation` setting to an empty string in your config file or
  by setting the `ANSIBLE_NULL_REPRESENTATION` environment variable.
* Added `meta: refresh_inventory` to force rereading the inventory in a play.
  This re-executes inventory scripts, but does not force them to ignore any cache they might use.
* New delegate_facts directive, a boolean that allows you to apply facts to the delegated host (true/yes) instead of the inventory_hostname (no/false) which is the default and previous behaviour.
* local connections now work with 'su' as a privilege escalation method
* Ansible 2.0 has deprecated the "ssh" from ansible_ssh_user, ansible_ssh_host, and ansible_ssh_port to become ansible_user, ansible_host, and ansible_port.
* New ssh configuration variables (`ansible_ssh_common_args`, `ansible_ssh_extra_args`) can be used to configure a
  per-group or per-host ssh ProxyCommand or set any other ssh options.
  `ansible_ssh_extra_args` is used to set options that are accepted only by ssh (not sftp or scp, which have their own analogous settings).
* ansible-pull can now verify the code it runs when using git as a source repository, using git's code signing and verification features.
* Backslashes used when specifying parameters in jinja2 expressions in YAML dicts sometimes needed to be escaped twice.
  This has been fixed so that escaping once works. Here's an example of how playbooks need to be modified:

    ```yaml
    # Syntax in 1.9.x
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ 'test1_junk 1\\\\3' | regex_replace('(.*)_junk (.*)', '\\\\1 \\\\2') }}"
    # Syntax in 2.0.x
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ 'test1_junk 1\\3' | regex_replace('(.*)_junk (.*)', '\\1 \\2') }}"

    # Output:
    "msg": "test1 1\\3"
    ```

* When a string with a trailing newline was specified in the playbook via yaml
dict format, the trailing newline was stripped. When specified in key=value
format the trailing newlines were kept. In v2, both methods of specifying the
string will keep the trailing newlines. If you relied on the trailing
newline being stripped you can change your playbook like this:

    ```yaml
    # Syntax in 1.9.2
    vars:
      message: >
        Testing
        some things
    tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"

    # Syntax in 2.0.x
    vars:
      old_message: >
        Testing
        some things
      message: "{{ old_messsage[:-1] }}"
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"
    # Output
    "msg": "Testing some things"
    ```

* When specifying complex args as a variable, the variable must use the full jinja2
variable syntax ('{{var_name}}') - bare variable names there are no longer accepted.
In fact, even specifying args with variables has been deprecated, and will not be
allowed in future versions:

    ```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      connection: local
      gather_facts: false
      vars:
        my_dirs:
          - { path: /tmp/3a, state: directory, mode: 0755 }
          - { path: /tmp/3b, state: directory, mode: 0700 }
      tasks:
        - file:
          args: "{{item}}"
          with_items: my_dirs
    ```

### Plugins

* Rewritten dnf module that should be faster and less prone to encountering bugs in cornercases
* WinRM connection plugin passes all vars named `ansible_winrm_*` to the underlying pywinrm client. This allows, for instance, `ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore` to be used with newer versions of pywinrm to disable certificate validation on Python 2.7.9+.
* WinRM connection plugin put_file is significantly faster and no longer has file size limitations.

* nagios_ndo
* nsot
* proxmox
* rudder
* serf

#### New Lookups:

* credstash
* hashi_vault
* ini
* shelvefile

#### New Filters:

* combine

#### New Connection:

* docker: for talking to docker containers on the ansible controller machine without using ssh.

#### New Callbacks:

* logentries: plugin to send play data to logentries service
* skippy: same as default but does not display skip messages

### Minor changes:

* Many more tests. The new API makes things more testable and we took advantage of it.
* big_ip modules now support turning off ssl certificate validation (use only for self-signed certificates).
* Consolidated code from modules using urllib2 to normalize features, TLS and SNI support.
* synchronize module's dest_port parameter now takes precedence over the ansible_ssh_port inventory setting.
* Play output is now dynamically sized to terminal with a minimum of 80 coluumns (old default).
* vars_prompt and pause are now skipped with a warning if the play is called noninteractively (i.e. pull from cron).
* Support for OpenBSD's 'doas' privilege escalation method.
* Most vault operations can now be done over multilple files.
* ansible-vault encrypt/decrypt read from stdin if no other input file is given, and can write to a given ``--output file`` (including stdout, '-').
  This lets you avoid ever writing sensitive plaintext to disk.
* ansible-vault rekey accepts the --new-vault-password-file option.
* ansible-vault now preserves file permissions on edit and rekey and defaults to restrictive permissions for other options.
* Configuration items defined as paths (local only) now all support shell style interpolations.
* Many fixes and new options added to modules, too many to list here.
* Now you can see task file and line number when using verbosity of 3 or above.
* The ``[x-y]`` host range syntax is no longer supported. Note that ``[0:1]`` matches two hosts, i.e. the range is inclusive of its endpoints.
* We now recommend the use of `pattern1,pattern2` to combine host matching patterns.
  * The use of ':' as a separator conflicts with IPv6 addresses and host ranges. It will be deprecated in the future.
  * The undocumented use of ';' as a separator is now deprecated.
* modules and callbacks have been extended to support no_log to avoid data disclosure.
* new managed_syslog option has been added to control output to syslog on managed machines, no_log supersedes this settings.
* Lookup, vars and action plugin pathing has been normalized, all now follow the same sequence to find relative files.
* We do not ignore the explicitly set login user for ssh when it matches the 'current user' anymore, this allows overriding .ssh/config when it is set
  explicitly. Leaving it unset will still use the same user and respect .ssh/config. This also means ansible_ssh_user can now return a None value.
* environment variables passed to remote shells now default to 'controller' settings, with fallback to en_US.UTF8 which was the previous default.
* add_hosts is much stricter about host name and will prevent invalid names from being added.
* ansible-pull now defaults to doing shallow checkouts with git, use `--full` to return to previous behaviour.
* random cows are more random
* when: now gets the registered var after the first iteration, making it possible to break out of item loops
* Handling of undefined variables has changed.  In most places they will now raise an error instead of silently injecting an empty string.  Use the default filter if you want to approximate the old behaviour:

    ```
    - debug: msg="The error message was: {{error_code |default('') }}"
    ```

## 1.9.7 "Dancing in the Street" - TBD

* Fix for lxc_container backport which was broken because it tried to use a feature from ansible-2.x

## 1.9.6 "Dancing in the Street" - Apr 15, 2016

* Fix a regression in the loading of inventory variables where they were not
  found when placed inside of an inventory directory.
* Fix lxc_container having predictable temp file names.  Addresses CVE-2016-3096

## 1.9.5 "Dancing In the Street" - Mar 21, 2016

* Compatibility fix with docker 1.8.
* Fix a bug with the crypttab module omitting certain characters from the name of the device
* Fix bug with uri module not handling all binary files
* Fix bug with ini_file not removing options set to an empty string
* Fix bug with script and raw modules not honoring parameters passed via yaml dict syntax
* Fix bug with plugin loading finding the wrong modules because the suffix checking was not ordered
* Fix bug in the literal_eval module code used when we need python-2.4 compat
* Added --ignore-certs, -c option to ansible-galaxy. Allows ansible-galaxy to work behind a proxy
  when the proxy fails to forward server certificates.
* Fixed bug where tasks marked no_log were showing hidden values in output if
  ansible's --diff option was used.
* Fix bug with non-english locales in git and apt modules
* Compatibility fix for using state=absent with the pip ansible module and pip-6.1.0+
* Backported support for ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation flag to disable cert validation on Python 2.7.9+ (and support for other passthru args to pywinrm transport).
* Backported various updates to user module (prevent accidental OS X group membership removals, various checkmode fixes).

## 1.9.4 "Dancing In the Street" - Oct 9, 2015

* Fixes a bug where yum state=latest would error if there were no updates to install.
* Fixes a bug where yum state=latest did not work with wildcard package names.
* Fixes a bug in lineinfile relating to escape sequences.
* Fixes a bug where vars_prompt was not keeping passwords private by default.
* Fix ansible-galaxy and the hipchat callback plugin to check that the host it
  is contacting matches its TLS Certificate.

## 1.9.3 "Dancing In the Street" - Sep 3, 2015

* Fixes a bug related to keyczar messing up encodings internally, resulting in decrypted
  messages coming out as empty strings.
* AES Keys generated for use in accelerated mode are now 256-bit by default instead of 128.
* Fix url fetching for SNI with python-2.7.9 or greater.  SNI does not work
  with python < 2.7.9.  The best workaround is probably to use the command
  module with curl or wget.
* Fix url fetching to allow tls-1.1 and tls-1.2 if the system's openssl library
  supports those protocols
* Fix ec2_ami_search module to check TLS Certificates
* Fix the following extras modules to check TLS Certificates:
  * campfire
  * layman
  * librarto_annotate
  * twilio
  * typetalk
* Fix docker module's parsing of docker-py version for dev checkouts
* Fix docker module to work with docker server api 1.19
* Change yum module's state=latest feature to update all packages specified in
  a single transaction.  This is the same type of fix as was made for yum's
  state=installed in 1.9.2 and both solves the same problems and with the same caveats.
* Fixed a bug where stdout from a module might be blank when there were were non-printable
  ASCII characters contained within it

## 1.9.2 "Dancing In the Street" - Jun 26, 2015

* Security fixes to check that hostnames match certificates with https urls (CVE-2015-3908)
  - get_url and uri modules
  - url and etcd lookup plugins
* Security fixes to the zone (Solaris containers), jail (bsd containers),
  and chroot connection plugins.  These plugins can be used to connect to
  their respective container types in leiu of the standard ssh connection.
  Prior to this fix being applied these connection plugins didn't properly
  handle symlinks within the containers which could lead to files intended to
  be written to or read from the container being written to or read from the
  host system instead. (CVE pending)
* Fixed a bug in the service module where init scripts were being incorrectly used instead of upstart/systemd.
* Fixed a bug where sudo/su settings were not inherited from ansible.cfg correctly.
* Fixed a bug in the rds module where a traceback may occur due to an unbound variable.
* Fixed a bug where certain remote file systems where the SELinux context was not being properly set.
* Re-enabled several windows modules which had been partially merged (via action plugins):
  - win_copy.ps1
  - win_copy.py
  - win_file.ps1
  - win_file.py
  - win_template.py
* Fix bug using with_sequence and a count that is zero.  Also allows counting backwards isntead of forwards
* Fix get_url module bug preventing use of custom ports with https urls
* Fix bug disabling repositories in the yum module.
* Fix giving yum module a url to install a package from on RHEL/CENTOS5
* Fix bug in dnf module preventing it from working when yum-utils was not already installed

## 1.9.1 "Dancing In the Street" - Apr 27, 2015

* Fixed a bug related to Kerberos auth when using winrm with a domain account.
* Fixing several bugs in the s3 module.
* Fixed a bug with upstart service detection in the service module.
* Fixed several bugs with the user module when used on OSX.
* Fixed unicode handling in some module situations (assert and shell/command execution).
* Fixed a bug in redhat_subscription when using the activationkey parameter.
* Fixed a traceback in the gce module on EL6 distros when multiple pycrypto installations are available.
* Added support for PostgreSQL 9.4 in rds_param_group
* Several other minor fixes.

## 1.9 "Dancing In the Street" - Mar 25, 2015

Major changes:

* Added kerberos support to winrm connection plugin.
* Tags rehaul: added 'all', 'always', 'untagged' and 'tagged' special tags and normalized
  tag resolution. Added tag information to --list-tasks and new --list-tags option.
* Privilege Escalation generalization, new 'Become' system and variables  now will
  handle existing and new methods. Sudo and su have been kept for backwards compatibility.
  New methods pbrun and pfexec in 'alpha' state, planned adding 'runas' for winrm connection plugin.
* Improved ssh connection error reporting, now you get back the specific message from ssh.
* Added facility to document task module return values for registered vars, both for
  ansible-doc and the docsite. Documented copy, stats and acl modules, the rest must be
  updated individually (we will start doing so incrementally).
* Optimize the plugin loader to cache available plugins much more efficiently.
  For some use cases this can lead to dramatic improvements in startup time.
* Overhaul of the checksum system, now supports more systems and more cases more reliably and uniformly.
* Fix skipped tasks to not display their parameters if no_log is specified.
* Many fixes to unicode support, standarized functions to make it easier to add to input/output boundaries.
* Added travis integration to github for basic tests, this should speed up ticket triage and merging.
* environment: directive now can also be applied to play and is inhertited by tasks, which can still override it.
* expanded facts and OS/distribution support for existing facts and improved performance with pypy.
* new 'wantlist' option to lookups allows for selecting a list typed variable vs a comma delimited string as the return.
* the shared module code for file backups now uses a timestamp resolution of seconds (previouslly minutes).
* allow for empty inventories, this is now a warning and not an error (for those using localhost and cloud modules).
* sped up YAML parsing in ansible by up to 25% by switching to CParser loader.

New Modules:

* cryptab *-- manages linux encrypted block devices*
* gce_img *-- for utilizing GCE image resources*
* gluster_volume *-- manage glusterfs volumes*
* haproxy *-- for the load balancer of same name*
* known_hosts *-- manages the ssh known_hosts file*
* lxc_container *-- manage lxc containers*
* patch *-- allows for patching files on target systems*
* pkg5 *-- installing and uninstalling packages on Solaris*
* pkg5_publisher *-- manages Solaris pkg5 repository configuration*
* postgresql_ext *-- manage postgresql extensions*
* snmp_facts *-- gather facts via snmp*
* svc *-- manages daemontools based services*
* uptimerobot *-- manage monitoring with this service*

New Filters:

* ternary: allows for trueval/falseval assignment dependent on conditional
* cartesian: returns the Cartesian product of 2 lists
* to_uuid: given a string it will return an ansible domain specific UUID
* checksum: uses the ansible internal checksum to return a hash from a string
* hash: get a hash from a string (md5, sha1, etc)
* password_hash: get a hash form as string that can be used as a password in the user module (and others)
* A whole set of ip/network manipulation filters: ipaddr,ipwrap,ipv4,ipv6ipsubnet,nthhost,hwaddr,macaddr

Other Notable Changes:

* New lookup plugins:
  * dig: does dns resolution and returns IPs.
  * url: allows pulling data from a url.

* New callback plugins:
  * syslog_json: allows logging play output to a syslog network server using json format

* Many new enhancements to the amazon web service modules:
  * ec2 now applies all specified security groups when creating a new instance.  Previously it was only applying one
  * ec2_vol gained the ability to specify the EBS volume type
  * ec2_vol can now detach volumes by specifying instance=None
  * Fix ec2_group to purge specific grants rather than whole rules
  * Added tenancy support for the ec2 module
  * rds module has gained the ability to manage tags and set charset and public accessibility
  * ec2_snapshot module gained the capability to remove snapshots
  * Add alias support for route53
  * Add private_zones support to route53
  * ec2_asg: Add wait_for_instances parameter that waits until an instance is ready before ending the ansible task
* Many new docker improvements:
  * restart_policy parameters to configure when the container automatically restarts
  * If the docker client or server doesn't support an option, the task will now fail instead of silently ignoring the option
  * Add insecure_registry parameter for connecting to registries via http
  * New parameter to set a container's domain name
  * Undeprecated docker_image module until there's replacement functionality
  * Allow setting the container's pid namespace
  * Add a pull parameter that chooses when ansible will look for more recent images in the registry
  * docker module states have been greatly enhanced.  The reworked and new states are:
    * present now creates but does not start containers
    * restarted always restarts a container
    * reloaded restarts a container if ansible detects that the configuration is different than what is specified
      * reloaded accounts for exposed ports, env vars, and volumes
  * Can now connect to the docker server using TLS
* Several source control modules had force parameters that defaulted to true.
  These have been changed to default to false so as not to accidentally lose
  work.  Playbooks that depended on the former behaviour simply need to add
  force=True to the task that needs it.  Affected modules:
  * bzr: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the bzr module used to
    default to removing the modifications on any operation.  Now the module
    will not remove the modifications unless force=yes is specified.
    Operations that depend on a clean working tree may fail unless force=yes is
    added.
  * git: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the git module will now
    fail unless force is explicitly specified.  Specifying force=yes will allow
    the module to revert and overwrite local modifications to make git actions
    succeed.
  * hg: When local modifications exist in a checkout, the hg module used to
    default to removing the modifications on any operation.  Now the module
    will not remove the modifications unless force=yes is specified.

* added the ability to set "instance filters" in the ec2.ini to limit results from the inventory plugin.
* upgrades for various variable precedence items and parsing related items
* added a new "follow" parameter to the file and copy modules, which allows actions to be taken on the target of a symlink rather than the symlink itself.
* if a module should ever traceback, it will return a standard error, catchable by ignore_errors, versus an 'unreachable'
* ec2_lc: added support for multiple new parameters like kernel_id, ramdisk_id and ebs_optimized.
* ec2_elb_lb: added support for the connection_draining_timeout and cross_az_load_balancing options.
* support for symbolic representations (ie. u+rw) for file permission modes (file/copy/template modules etc.).

  ``recursive`` parameter to handle submodules, ansible would track the
  submodule upstream's head revision.  This has been changed to checkout the
  version of the submodule specified in the superproject's git repository.
  This is inline with what git submodule update does.  If you want the old
  behaviour use the new module parameter track_submodules=yes
* Checksumming of transferred files has been made more portable and now uses
  the sha1 algorithm instead of md5 to be compatible with FIPS-140.
  - As a small side effect, the fetch module no longer returns a useful value
    in remote_md5.  If you need a replacement, switch to using remote_checksum
    which returns the sha1sum of the remote file.
* ansible-doc CLI tool contains various improvements for working with different terminals

## 1.3 "Top of the World" - September 13th, 2013

Highlighted new features:

* accelerated mode: An enhanced fireball mode that requires zero bootstrapping and fewer requirements plus adds capabilities like sudo commands.
* role defaults: Allows roles to define a set of variables at the lowest priority. These variables can be overridden by any other variable.
* new /etc/ansible/facts.d allows JSON or INI-style facts to be provided from the remote node, and supports executable fact programs in this dir. Files must end in *.fact.
* added the ability to make undefined template variables raise errors (see ansible.cfg)
* (DOCS PENDING) sudo: True/False and sudo_user: True/False can be set at include and role level
* added changed_when: (expression) which allows overriding whether a result is changed or not and can work with registered expressions
* --extra-vars can now take a file as input, e.g., "-e @filename" and can also be formatted as YAML
* external inventory scripts may now return host variables in one pass, which allows them to be much more efficient for large numbers of hosts
* if --forks exceeds the numbers of hosts, it will be automatically reduced. Set forks to 0 and you get "as many forks as I have hosts" out of the box.
* enabled error_on_undefined_vars by default, which will make errors in playbooks more obvious
* role dependencies -- one role can now pull in another, with parameters of its own.
* added the ability to have tasks execute even during a check run (always_run).
* added the ability to set the maximum failure percentage for a group of hosts.

## 1.2.3 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- Aug 21, 2013

* Local security fixes for predictable file locations for ControlPersist and retry file paths on shared machines
on operating systems without kernel symlink/hardlink protections.

## 1.2.2 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- July 4, 2013

* Added a configuration file option [paramiko_connection] record_host_keys which allows the code that paramiko uses
to update known_hosts to be disabled.  This is done because paramiko can be very slow at doing this if you have a
large number of hosts and some folks may not want this behavior.  This can be toggled independently of host key checking
and does not affect the ssh transport plugin.  Use of the ssh transport plugin is preferred if you have ControlPersist
capability, and Ansible by default in 1.2.1 and later will autodetect.

## 1.2.1 "Hear About It Later" -- July 4, 2013

* Connection default is now "smart", which discovers if the system openssh can support ControlPersist, and uses
  it if so, if not falls back to paramiko.
* Host key checking is on by default.  Disable it if you like by adding host_key_checking=False in the [default]
  section of /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg or ~/ansible.cfg or by exporting ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
* Paramiko now records host keys it was in contact with host key checking is on.  It is somewhat sluggish when doing this,
  so switch to the 'ssh' transport if this concerns you.

## 1.2 "Right Now" -- June 10, 2013

Core Features:

* capability to set 'all_errors_fatal: True' in a playbook to force any error to stop execution versus
  a whole group or serial block needing to fail
  usable, without breaking the ability to override in ansible
* ability to use variables from {{ }} syntax in mainline playbooks, new 'when' conditional, as detailed
  in documentation.  Can disable old style replacements in ansible.cfg if so desired, but are still active
  by default.
* can set ansible_ssh_private_key_file as an inventory variable (similar to ansible_ssh_host, etc)
* 'when' statement can be affixed to task includes to auto-affix the conditional to each task therein
* cosmetic: "*****" banners in ansible-playbook output are now constant width
* --limit can now be given a filename (--limit @filename) to constrain a run to a host list on disk
* failed playbook runs will create a retry file in /var/tmp/ansible usable with --limit
* roles allow easy arrangement of reusable tasks/handlers/files/templates
* pre_tasks and post_tasks allow for separating tasks into blocks where handlers will fire around them automatically
* "meta: flush_handler" task capability added for when you really need to force handlers to run
* new --start-at-task option to ansible playbook allows starting at a specific task name in a long playbook
* added a log file for ansible/ansible-playbook, set 'log_path' in the configuration file or ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH in environment
* debug mode always outputs debug in playbooks, without needing to specify -v
* external inventory script added for Spacewalk / Red Hat Satellite servers
* It is now possible to feed JSON structures to --extra-vars.  Pass in a JSON dictionary/hash to feed in complex data.
* group_vars/ and host_vars/ directories can now be kept alongside the playbook as well as inventory (or both!)
* more filters: ability to say {{ foo|success }} and {{ foo|failed }} and when: foo|success and when: foo|failed
* more filters: {{ path|basename }} and {{ path|dirname }}
* lookup plugins now use the basedir of the file they have included from, avoiding needs of ../../../ in places and
increasing the ease at which things can be reorganized.

## 0.8 "Cathedral" -- Oct 19, 2012

Highlighted Core Changes:

* fireball mode -- ansible can bootstrap a ephemeral 0mq (zeromq) daemon that runs as a given user and expires after X period of time.  It is very fast.
* playbooks with errors now return 2 on failure.  1 indicates a more fatal syntax error.  Similar for /usr/bin/ansible
* server side action code (template, etc) are now fully pluggable
* ability to write lookup plugins, like the code powering "with_fileglob" (see below)

Other Core Changes:

* ansible config file can also go in 'ansible.cfg' in cwd in addition to ~/.ansible.cfg and /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
* fix for inventory hosts at API level when hosts spec is a list and not a colon delimited string
* ansible-pull example now sets up logrotate for the ansible-pull cron job log
* negative host matching (!hosts) fixed for external inventory script usage
* internals: os.executable check replaced with utils function so it plays nice on AIX
* Debian packaging now includes ansible-pull manpage
* magic variable 'ansible_ssh_host' can override the hostname (great for usage with tunnels)
* date command usage in build scripts fixed for OS X
* don't use SSH agent with paramiko if a password is specified
* make output be cleaner on multi-line command/shell errors
* /usr/bin/ansible now prints things when tasks are skipped, like when creates= is used with -m command and /usr/bin/ansible
* when trying to async a module that is not a 'normal' asyncable module, ansible will now let you know
* ability to access inventory variables via 'hostvars' for hosts not yet included in any play, using on demand lookups
* merged ansible-plugins, ansible-resources, and ansible-docs into the main project
* you can set ANSIBLE_NOCOWS=1 if you want to disable cowsay if it is installed.  Though no one should ever want to do this!  Cows are great!
* you can set ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=1 to force color mode even when running without a TTY
* fatal errors are now properly colored red.
* skipped messages are now cyan, to differentiate them from unchanged messages.
* extensive documentation upgrades
* delegate_action to localhost (aka local_action) will always use the local connection type

Highlighted playbook changes:

* is_set is available for use inside of an only_if expression:  is_set('ansible_eth0').  We intend to further upgrade this with a 'when'
  keyword providing better options to 'only_if' in the next release.   Also is_unset('ansible_eth0')
* playbooks can import playbooks in other directories and then be able to import tasks relative to them
* FILE($path) now allows access of contents of file in a path, very good for use with SSH keys
* similarly PIPE($command) will run a local command and return the results of executing this command
* if all hosts in a play fail, stop the playbook, rather than letting the console log spool on by
* only_if using register variables that are booleans now works in a boolean way like you'd expect
* task includes now work with with_items (such as: include: path/to/wordpress.yml user=$item)
* when using a $list variable with $var or ${var} syntax it will automatically join with commas
* setup is not run more than once when we know it is has already been run in a play that included another play, etc
* can set/override sudo and sudo_user on individual tasks in a play, defaults to what is set in the play if not present
* ability to use with_fileglob to iterate over local file patterns
* templates now use Jinja2's 'trim_blocks=True' to avoid stray newlines, small changes to templates may
be required in rare cases.

Other playbook changes:

* to_yaml and from_yaml are available as Jinja2 filters
* $group and $group_names are now accessible in with_items
* where 'stdout' is provided a new 'stdout_lines' variable (type == list) is now generated and usable with with_items
* when local_action is used the transport is automatically overridden to the local type
* output on failed playbook commands is now nicely split for stderr/stdout and syntax errors
* if local_action is not used and delegate_to was 127.0.0.1 or localhost, use local connection regardless
* when running a playbook, and the statement has changed, prints 'changed:' now versus 'ok:' so it is obvious without colored mode
* variables now usable within vars_prompt (just not host/group vars)
* setup facts are now retained across plays (dictionary just gets updated as needed)
* --sudo-user now works with --extra-vars
* fix for multi_line strings with only_if

New Modules:

* ini_file module for manipulating INI files
* new LSB facts (release, distro, etc)

* postgresql modules now take an optional port= parameter
* /proc/cmdline info is now available in Linux facts
* public host key detection for OS X
